# About This Portfolio

This repository organizes writing on public health, aging, and emergency preparedness with structured metadata for each piece.

## Purpose

This portfolio serves multiple purposes:

- **Professional showcase**: Demonstrate writing skills across different formats (op-eds, policy briefs, toolkits, reports)
- **Metadata standardization**: Organize work with consistent, queryable fields (topics, populations, methods, outcomes)
- **Reusability**: Enable quick identification of relevant work samples for applications, grant proposals, or portfolio reviews

## Structure

Each article in `_articles/` includes:

- **Bibliographic metadata**: title, publication, date, role
- **Thematic tags**: topics, populations served, geographic focus
- **Methods and outputs**: research approach, final deliverables
- **Impact tracking**: audience, outcomes, usage

All metadata is stored in YAML front matter, making it machine-readable and sortable.

## Background
