## Overview

This op-ed examined policy gaps in Los Angeles County's cooling center network that create barriers for older adults during extreme heat events. Drawing on emergency management plans, CDC guidelines, and heat mortality data, the piece identified three key areas where current approaches fall short: transportation access, facility operating hours, and outreach to isolated seniors. The article proposed actionable improvements that local governments could implement within existing budgets.

## Contribution

- Clarified gaps in extreme heat planning for older adults in Los Angeles County
- Synthesized local cooling center policies with CDC and California state guidance
- Proposed three low-cost improvements for outreach, transportation, and facility operations
- Translated technical emergency management findings into plain-language recommendations

## Process and methods

- Reviewed city and county emergency operations plans and cooling center protocols
- Analyzed recent heat mortality and morbidity data from LA County Department of Public Health
- Summarized CDC and state Office of Emergency Services guidance on vulnerable populations
- Conducted informal interviews with two community-based organizations serving older adults
- Drafted article in collaboration with AARP Foundation communications team

## Impact

The article was shared with LA County Office of Emergency Management and cited in internal advocacy materials. It informed AARP Foundation's recommendations for the county's 2024 heat response plan update.
