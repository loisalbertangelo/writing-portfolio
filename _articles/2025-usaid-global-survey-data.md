## Overview
This article examines the elimination of the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) program following the Trump administration's dismantling of USAID, and its impact on global public health data collection.

## My Contribution
I wrote this news article for the NYU GPH Journal of Public Health Disasters, analyzing the consequences of eliminating critical health data infrastructure that tracked vital health indicators across 90 low- and middle-income countries.

## Process
I researched the history and importance of the DHS program, interviewed sources about the program's shutdown, and examined the broader implications for global health monitoring and policy-making. The article synthesizes information about the program's decades-long data collection efforts and the immediate impact of its termination.

## Impact
The article highlights how the loss of DHS data affects resource allocation decisions, policy adjustments, and the ability to track health interventions in countries that relied on this critical infrastructure for public health surveillance.
